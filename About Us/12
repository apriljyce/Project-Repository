			<p>Baguio Colleges, as the University of the Cordilleras was earlier known, pioneered in tertiary education in the mountain highlands of the Cordillera region amidst devastation in and around Baguio City after the Second World War. <br></p>

			<p>Despite a pessimistic outlook and the bleak prospects pervading the climate of any undertaking at that time, Atty. Benjamin R. Salvosa envisioned Baguio City as a university town. With such vision, he unauntedly pursued a noble mission by founding a college. <br></p>

			<p>It was on June 19, 1946, coinciding with the birth annoversary of Dr. Jose P. Rizal, that a historic event unfolded. Baguio Colleges was established initially offering courses in teacher training and liberal arts, with the first batch of enrollees consisting of 156 students. Classes were first held in rented spaces at the Antipolo building, and later, at the Lopez and Lamping buildings along Session Road, the city's main thoroughfare. <br></p>

			<p>1966 became a turning point for Baguio Colleges as it was converted into an educational foundation.

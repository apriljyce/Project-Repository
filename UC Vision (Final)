University of the Cordilleras Vision

Into the next half century of the service to the youth, we envision UC as a community of scholars more aggressively involved in the pursuit and advancement of knowledge in all its dimensions, as an end in itself and as a tool in personal, community and national development.

Uc shall help preserve and develop Filipino culture and values, shall assist in rearing the Filipino youth to their fullest potentials by training them to think critically and creatively, to act positively, to contribute to the development of a wholesome family, community and the larger society.

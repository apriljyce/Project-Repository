		<font size="3" face="calibri">
			<p>Baguio Colleges, as the University of the Cordilleras was earlier known, pioneered in tertiary education in the mountain highlands of the Cordillera region amidst devastation in and around Baguio City after the Second World War. <br></p>

			<p>Despite a pessimistic outlook and the bleak prospects pervading the climate of any undertaking at that time, Atty. Benjamin R. Salvosa envisioned Baguio City as a university town. With such vision, he unauntedly pursued a noble mission by founding a college. <br></p>

			<p>It was on June 19, 1946, coinciding with the birth annoversary of Dr. Jose P. Rizal, that a historic event unfolded. Baguio Colleges was established initially offering courses in teacher training and liberal arts, with the first batch of enrollees consisting of 156 students. Classes were first held in rented spaces at the Antipolo building, and later, at the Lopez and Lamping buildings along Session Road, the city's main thoroughfare. <br></p>

			<p>1966 became a turning point for Baguio Colleges as it was converted into an educational foundation. Since then, it has blazed new trails and has become more responsive to the needs of the time. <br></p>

			<p>The founder, Atty. Benjamin R. Salvosa sat as the Chairman of the Board of Trustees and held the reins of the presidency up to early part of 1944. <br></p>

			<p>Through the years, the University of the Cordilleras has grown bigger through the offering of additional coourses and increasing student enrollment. It continues to grow even better with time, as evidenced by exemplary performance in various fields of discipline, with its graduates shinning in national licensure examinations, and its alumni doing well in private employment, in the practice of their trade and profession, and in public service. <br></p>

			<p>Today, the University of the Cordilleras caters to more than 18,00 students coming from the Cordillera Administrative Region (CAR), Regions I and II, neighboring provinces of Luzon. In addition, UC has the largest population of international students among HEIs in Baguio City represented by 37 nationalities. Programs offeres now range from basic education to graduate studies, law, arts and sciences, business and accountancy, nursing, teacher education, information technology and computer science, hospitality and tourism, and criminal justice. <br></p>

			<p>UC received recognitions which are testaments to its delivery of quality educational services. In 20119, UC's was hailed ISO 9001:2015 Certified. The Commission on Higher Education has granted UC the Autonomous University Status. The commission has likewise identified three(3) Centers of Excellence in UC namely Information Technology, Criminology, and Teacher Education. The University's College of Law is rated among the top law schools in the country, notably having graduated two (2) Bar Examination First Placers. Additionally, over 20 programs have been accredited by private accrediting bodies. <br></p>

			<p>The University of the Cordilleras is blessed to serve these mountain highlands. <br></p>
